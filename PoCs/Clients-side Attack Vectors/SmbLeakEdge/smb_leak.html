10.0.61.72 runs reponder with the following options:
responder -I eth0 -w -r f -v 

As soon as the mouse is in the page, the request triggers in Edge 15/Win10
 without user interaction since the link is auto-clicked. Credentials are leaked
 to responder.

 Doesn't work on Chrome on Windows. on Chrome for OSX just shows a normal credential
 prompt (like a BasicAuth protected resource) and responder captures anything entered.
